# Domain-Info-Fetcher Roadmap

This document outlines the planned development roadmap for domain-info-fetcher. It details upcoming features, improvements, and target release dates.

## Project Vision

Domain-info-fetcher aims to be a comprehensive, versatile tool for domain information retrieval that serves both technical and non-technical users. The tool supports both individual domain analysis and bulk operations, with flexible interfaces including a programmatic API, command-line interface, and web-based access.

## Release Plan

### Version 2.3.0: WHOIS Integration ✅

**Status:** COMPLETED (March 2025)

#### Features Added:

- WHOIS data retrieval using built-in Node.js modules
- Extended `DomainInfo` interface to include WHOIS data
- Cached WHOIS queries to respect rate limits
- Data extraction for:
  - Registration dates
  - Expiration dates
  - Registrar information
  - Contact information (when available)
  - Domain status codes

#### Tasks Completed:

1. ✅ Researched WHOIS protocol implementation with built-in modules
2. ✅ Created WHOIS module with functionality to fetch WHOIS data
3. ✅ Implemented TLD-specific WHOIS server mapping
4. ✅ Added parsing for different WHOIS response formats
5. ✅ Integrated with existing `fetchDomainInfo` function
6. ✅ Added comprehensive test coverage
7. ✅ Updated documentation and examples

### Version 2.4.0: Batch Processing Engine

**Target:** Next phase (3-4 weeks)

#### Features:

- Concurrent domain processing with configurable limits
- Rate limiting to prevent overwhelming DNS servers
- Progress tracking for long-running operations
- Error handling that continues through individual failures
- Aggregate results with success/failure counts

#### Tasks:

1. Implement `fetchMultipleDomainInfo(domains: string[], options)` function
2. Add concurrency control and rate limiting
3. Create progress tracking system using events
4. Develop robust error handling and retry logic
5. Optimize performance for large domain lists
6. Add comprehensive test coverage
7. Update documentation with batch processing examples

### Version 3.0.0: Interface Enhancements

**Target:** Phase 3 (2-3 weeks after Phase 2)

#### Features:

- Enhanced CLI with batch processing capabilities
- Multiple export formats (JSON, CSV, formatted tables)
- Filtering options to include/exclude specific data
- Improved error reporting and diagnostics
- Breaking changes warrant major version bump

#### Tasks:

1. Add batch processing options to CLI (`--file`, `--concurrency`)
2. Implement progress bars for CLI batch operations
3. Create data export utilities with multiple format options
4. Add filtering capabilities for output customization
5. Enhance error reporting with categorization
6. Update documentation and migration guide
7. Create examples for common use cases

### Version 3.1.0: GitHub Pages Web Interface

**Target:** Phase 4 (3-4 weeks after Phase 3)

#### Features:

- Simple web interface for non-technical users
- Backend API proxy to handle requests
- Visual presentation of domain data
- Mobile-friendly responsive design
- No installation required for quick lookups

#### Tasks:

1. Create lightweight serverless backend using Vercel/Netlify
2. Design user-friendly interface for GitHub Pages
3. Implement client-side form handling and validation
4. Develop interactive data visualizations
5. Add export/sharing functionality
6. Ensure responsive design and accessibility
7. Document usage for non-technical users

### Version 3.2.0: Dashboard Support

**Target:** Phase 5 (2-3 weeks after Phase 4)

#### Features:

- Specialized data formats for dashboard integration
- Time-series support for trend monitoring
- Domain health scoring system
- Integration utilities for popular dashboard platforms
- Alerting thresholds for critical changes

#### Tasks:

1. Develop dashboard-specific data output formats
2. Create domain health scoring algorithms
3. Implement webhook support for monitoring integration
4. Add scheduling utilities for periodic checks
5. Create example dashboard configurations
6. Develop visualization examples
7. Document integration with popular systems

## Future Considerations

Beyond version 3.2.0, we're considering the following enhancements:

- **Security Scanning**: Basic security checks (open ports, known vulnerabilities)
- **Historical Data**: Tracking changes over time
- **Content Analysis**: Basic content inspection and categorization
- **Domain Reputation**: Integration with reputation databases
- **Performance Metrics**: Basic web performance statistics
